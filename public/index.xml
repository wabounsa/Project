      <description>Avatar the Last Airbender is my most favorite show of all time, with a world that feels alive, characters that are fun, and magic that feels natural and fun. I am going to use the avatar.csv data set, which was found on Tidy Tuesday. The data consist of 11 variables and 13,385 observations. The id variable is an integer that is purely used to uniquely identifyeach row. The book is a character that shows which book, or season, the line is in.</description>

      <description>The password data set from tidytuesday contains a list of many commonly used passwords.
Easiest Passwords to Crack The data set may sort the data set on most common, but what about easiest to crack. Probably the first 10, since they are the most common, but what about the rest? Keep in mind, we will be using the value variable as the basis for this analysis, which, in conjunction with the time_unit variable, states how fast it is to guess or solve this password online.</description>
