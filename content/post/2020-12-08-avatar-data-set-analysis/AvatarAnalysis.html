<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender is my favorite TV show of all time. The world feels alive, the characters are fleshed out, and the magic is natural and fun. That is what led me to analyse the Avatar: The Last Airbender data set provided by tidytuesday. The data set goes over every line of every episode and puts it into a nice data set to be analysed.</p>
