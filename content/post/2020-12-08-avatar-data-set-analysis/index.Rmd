*Avatar: The Last Airbender* has always been my favorite TV show. World felt alive, the characters are fleshed out, and the magic feels fun and natural. Thanks to the *Avatar: The Last Airbender* data set on tidytuesday, we are able to go through every line of every script for every episode and do some data analysis.

## "Special Move"

In other kids shows, like *Power Rangers*, the main characters and will yell say their special moves often, enough to have it ingrained into your head. How often does *Avatar: The Last Airbender* do this, and who does it the most?

```{r, message=FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-08-11')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 33)
avatar <- tuesdata$avatar
avatar
Katara <- avatar %>%
  filter(character == "Katara")
```
